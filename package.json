  "description": "Nothing fancy here. Just a few functions for generating SVG elements that appear to be *drawn by hand* in marker, including lines, curves, arrows, circles, polygons, dots, and text (in my own handwriting). The colors and other styling are meant to imitate the look of drawing on a whiteboard. Right now the functions are very similar to those in [svg-napkin](https://github.com/TripleDataArts/svg-napkin), but I expect them to diverge a bit as they're developed.",
